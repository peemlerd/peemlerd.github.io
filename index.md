## About Me

Welcome to my homepage! I am a PhD candidate in <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/academics/phd/statistics-public-policy/index.html">Statistics and Public Policy</a> at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~nynke/">Professor Nynke Niezink</a> and 
<a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/davidch/">Professor David Choi</a>.  I am interested in questions in the intersection of causal inference, network science, and public policy. 

Prior to CMU, I studied Mathematics and Computer Science at Swarthmore College under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Scholarship_(Thailand)">King's Scholarship</autocolor> from the Thai Government. 

## Research Interests

- **Causal Inference** Interference, Semiparametric Theory.
- **Network Science** Network Evolution, Social Network Analysis.
