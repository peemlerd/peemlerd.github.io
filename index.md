## About Me

Welcome to my homepage! I am a PhD candidate in Statistics and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), working under the supervision of Professor Nynke Niezink and Professor David Choi. 

Prior to CMU, I studied Mathematics and Computer Science at Swarthmore College where I am fortunate to research with <a href="https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~brody/"><autocolor>Professor Joshua Brody </autocolor> and <a href="http://paleo.domains.swarthmore.edu/"><autocolor> Professor Steve Wang </autocolor>. 

I obtained a King's Scholarship from Royal Thai Government.
